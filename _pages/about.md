    <p> A Tech Enthusiast </p>
    <p> Formula 1 Fanatic, and Empathy Advocate! </p>


Hey there! I'm Harsh Vora, and I'm thrilled to take you on a journey through my world. Originally from Santa in Madhya Pradesh, India, I'm currently diving deep into the world of Engineering Management at Duke University.
I've always been fascinated by technology, from exploring AI and cybersecurity during my Computer Science Engineering days to working on innovative tech solutions at Deloitte. But what truly drives me is the human connection behind the technology. My top strengths – WOO, Communication, Strategic thinking, Responsibility, and Significance – all fuel my empathy, helping me understand and connect with people on a deeper level.
When I'm not buried in coursework, you'll likely find me engrossed in Formula 1 racing strategies, writing about my adventures, or soaking in the melodies of my favorite tunes. And let's not forget my love for adventure sports and bike rides – nothing beats the thrill of adrenaline!
My journey has been shaped by incredible experiences, like my time with the International Society of Automation (ISA), where I explored robotics and collaborative innovation. Now, at Duke, I'm diving into areas like Design Thinking and Marketing Strategies, always with an eye toward making a positive impact in the world.
So, whether it's discussing the latest tech trends or sharing stories from the racetrack, I'm here to connect, learn, and grow with you. Let's embark on this adventure together!
